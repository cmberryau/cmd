This was a small game made with two other students while at RMIT University in 2010.

Getting the project to compile will most likely be tricky, it's 'old' now and had some bizzare compiling steps (it was compiled and ran on Nintendo DS hardware)

I'll update it at some point and make it easy to compile, run and play!

Heres a video from an early build - the one we presented at the end of University https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rn8KLvEyMpE
